# Writing Orders

## General Rules

All orders should be typed or clearly printed on 8.5 by 11 inch paper, and pages should be numbered if there are more than one.

At the top of each page of his turn, the player places his signature, player name, player ID No., game No., and game turn number.

The game turn No. is the number of the last print-out received.

To distinguish between zero and O, the player writes his zero's with a slash through them: 0.

All orders referring to a quantity of a unit do not need a comma between the quantity and the unit.

Orders should be written in the same order as the Sequence of Play; orders not written this way may not be executed.
For instance, if a player writes an assembly order before a dis-assembly order, the computer will decide that there is no assembly order, and the assembly order will not be executed.

All orders are addressed to ships or colonies.
The I.D. No. of the ship or colony is the first part of most orders.

Orders are carried out only if the ship or colony has the necessary units to fulfill the order.
For example, if a player ordered 100 space drives transferred, and he only has 60, then only 60 space dives will be transferred.

Players can use "//" to prefix comments in their orders.
The "//" and all text to then end of the line will be ignored by the parser.
For example,

    // This is a comment
    39, bombard, 121, 75%. // This is a comment

is the same as

    39, bombard, 121, 75%.
